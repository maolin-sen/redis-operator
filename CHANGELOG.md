## [v1.0.0-rc.4] - 2019-12-17

### Changes
- Update kooper to v0.8.0
- Update kubernetes to v1.15.6
- Add support for `hostNetwork` and `dnsPolicy` in Redis and Sentinel pods #212 @paol

## [v1.0.0-rc.3] - 2019-12-10

### Action required

Since update logic has been moved to operator, `PodManagementPolicy` has been set to `Parallel` in redis statefulSet. This improve bootstrap times.
This field is immutable so to upgrade from previous rc releases you need to delete statefulSets manually. 
*Note:* you can use `--cascade=false` flag to avoid disruption, pods will be adopted by the new statefulSet created by the operator.
example: `kubectl delete statefulset --cascade=false rfr-redisfailover`

### Changes

- Move rolling update strategy to redis-operator to be cluster-aware #203 @chusAlvarez
- Readiness probe check nodes belong to the cluster and are synced #206 @chusAlvarez
- Support label propagation filter #195 @adamhf

### Fix

- Documentation and examples #204 @shonge
- Add RBAC policy to access secrets #208 @hoffoo

- Add redis authentication @hoffoo
- Configurable imagePullSecret @romanfurst 
- Configurable imagePullPolicy @mcdiae 
- Support for node selector `nodeSelector` @sergeunity 

### Fix

- Examples documentation  @SataQiu @marcemq 
- Chart service labels @timmyers
